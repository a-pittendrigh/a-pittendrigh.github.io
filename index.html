        <p>
            For the longest time I've wanted to have my own blog.
            I've wanted to create something that would allow me to share what I've learnt, but also something that I
            could use to teach myself in turn, by doing things I've always wanted to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            The blog will evolve over time, as I learn new things and implement them here.
            Content will be ordered in descending date of publication (newest to oldest).
        </p>
        <p>
            I want the blog to integrate with other platforms, to look beautiful, to be elegant in code and in how
            it
            looks.
            I want the blog to be easy to index, so that any helpful things I find are freely available to the
            public,
            and easy to find.
        </p>
        <p>
            The blog is using GitHub pages for now, but I feel like experimenting with server-side rending in
            Clojure.
            Perhaps it's best to just experiment at work and blog here, since switching to a served blog will
            introduce
            many hurdles.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, I want to switch the blog to <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">Hiccup</a>, because
            while HTML is great for content markup, it's not as nice for developers as Hiccup is.
        </p>
